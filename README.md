# Trading-AI (Work In Progress)

🚀 **Agentic AI-based Crypto Trading Bot** (Work in Progress)

This project is a complete end-to-end Agentic AI approach to build an **automated crypto trading system** using live market data, strategic agents, and a central AI brain powered by LLMs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Trading-AI is a modular and intelligent trading bot framework designed for cryptocurrency markets. It leverages multiple specialized agents to:
- Collect and preprocess crypto market and news data.
- Analyze trends using psychological, technical, and fundamental reasoning.
- Make collaborative decisions through a voting system.
- Execute trades based on agent consensus.

The architecture mirrors a **multi-agent system** where each agent has a specific role and communicates through a shared message queue.

---

## ✅ Current Progress

- ✅ Data pipeline and agent infrastructure implemented.
- ✅ Integration with crypto exchanges and news APIs.
- ✅ Basic voting and decision-making system built.
- ⏳ **Pending:** Integration of the **LLM brain** to serve as the central decision-maker.

---

## 🧠 LLM Integration (To Be Added)

You can use **DeepSeek AI** (or any other LLM) to train and fine-tune the language model that will act as the central brain of the bot. This model will:
- Interpret market context and agent outputs.
- Make final trading decisions.
- Adapt strategies based on market sentiment and trends.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI (for communication)
- Redis / RabbitMQ (message queue)
- PostgreSQL / Time-series DB
- DeepSeek / Open-source LLMs

---

## 💡 Vision

The goal is to create a **self-evolving, intelligent, and collaborative trading system** that mimics human-like thinking and adapts to market dynamics with minimal manual input.
